THE LUNA MU 6742 IS A VARI MU COMPRESSOR/LIMITER MODELED AFTER THE FAIRCHILD 670 WITH A TAPE SATURATOR (EMULATOR) MODELED AFTER THE NEVE 542.
THE LUNA MU HAS ALL FEATURES OF ORIGINAL UNITS WITH A FEW MORE ADDED FEATURES. 
THE COMPRESSOR SECTION IS STEREO MID/SIDE AND THE TAPE SATURATOR/EMULATOR IS STEREO.
THE LUNA MU WAS MADE TO EMULATE BOTH UNITS USING SPEC SHEETS AND ORIGINAL SIGNAL DIAGRAMS TO SOUND AS CLOSE AS POSIBLE TO ORIGINAL UNITS.

COMPRESSOR/LIMTER

is a stereo variable-mu tube limiter known for its smooth, musical compression and warm, colored tone. A complex and highly-engineered unit,
 it contains a total of 20 vacuum tubes and 11 custom-wound transformers. 

Tube complement

rich sound is created by its extensive tube architecture, with specific types designated for amplification, compression, and the power supply. 
Audio path and control tubes
8 x 6386 (Variable-mu tubes): This is the core component for gain reduction. The 6386 is a variable-mu or remote cut-off tube whose gain is controlled by a high DC control voltage.
2 x 12AX7 (Dual triodes): Used in the audio amplification stages.
4 x 6973 (Power pentodes): Used in the push-pull output stage for each of the two stereo channels.
2 x 12BH7 (Dual triodes): Used as voltage and current gain stages.
1 x E80F or EF806 (Pentode): Used in the control voltage circuit.
1 x 5651 (Voltage regulator tube): A gas regulator tube used in the sidechain voltage regulation. 
Power supply tubes
1 x EL34 (Power tube): Used in the unit's power supply.
1 x GZ34 (Rectifier tube): A tube rectifier for the power supply. 

Transformer specifications

The transformer-coupled design, using 11 custom-designed transformers play a crucial role in shaping the unit's tonal color and behavior. 
The specific manufacturer details and proprietary specs of these custom-wound transformers are not publicly available for vintage units. 
Quantity: 11 transformers.Input Impedance: 600 \(\Omega \).Output Impedance: 600 \(\Omega \).Purpose: These transformers are used for signal coupling at the input and output stages, 
as well as for power supply isolation and filtering. 

TAPE SATURATOR/EMULATOR

is a tape emulator module that combines an analog tape saturation circuit with custom transformers and variable color/Texture
 control. This module provides a wide range of tonal options by blending the effects of the "True Tape" circuit, color, and transformers. The official specifications are often broken
 down into two sections: those for the transparent line amplifier (with the tape circuit disengaged) and those for the tape emulation circuit itself. Line amplifier specifications 
(tape circuit disengaged) This mode provides a high-performance, transformer-coupled line amplifier. Noise: Better than -100 dBu (unity gain, unweighted, 20 Hz–22 kHz).Frequency
 Response:\(\pm 0.25\) dB from 5 Hz to 60 kHz.-2 dB at 120 kHz.Total Harmonic Distortion and Noise (THD+N):Better than 0.0025% at 1 kHz,
 +20 dBu output level.0.07% at 20 Hz, +20 dBu output level (typical 2nd and 3rd harmonics).Maximum Output Level: +23.25 dBu. "True Tape" effects specifications This data covers 
the characteristics of the tape emulation circuit, which includes the custom interstage transformer. The tone is affected by the Saturation, 7.5/15/30 IPS, and color/Texture controls. 
Noise (typical, saturation at minimum): Better than -100 dBu (unweighted, 20 Hz–22 kHz).15 IPS mode (Tape effect engaged):Frequency Response: A low-frequency "head bump" centered 
around 60 Hz and a high-frequency rolloff.THD+N (nominal): Varies with saturation and frequency. For example, 0.4% at 3 kHz and 1% at 175 Hz 
typical (input at 0 dBu, minimum saturation).30 IPS mode (Tape effect engaged):Frequency Response: A flatter high-end response with a low-frequency
 "head bump" around 120 Hz.THD+N (nominal): Varies with saturation and frequency. For example, 1% at 1 kHz typical (input at 0 dBu, minimum saturation). 
Transformers and controls The 542's rich tonal qualities are also shaped by its components and features. Custom Transformers: The module uses custom-designed interstage transformers. 
These act as a "record head," and their behavior, along with a custom replay amplifier, produces the analog tape saturation effect.Variable colr/Texture: 
This control offers a continuously variable amount of harmonic coloration, from the subtle color mode found in earlier Portico designs to a more pronounced effect reminiscent
 of vintage Class-A gear.color orange (warm): Emphasizes harmonic content in the mid and high frequencies.color Blue: Emphasizes harmonic content in the low frequencies.Blend Control:
 This knob allows you to mix the original dry signal with the processed "True Tape" sound, enabling parallel processing. 


COMPRESSOR/LIMITER section features:

time constant knob - 
Position 1:
0.2 ms attack, 300 ms release. Best for handling sharp transients in drums, percussion, and plucked instruments. 
Position 2:
0.2 ms attack, 800 ms release. Good for vocals, bass, and overheads, providing a slightly longer release. 
Position 3:
0.4 ms attack, 2-second release. A balanced setting for mix bus, ballads, and acoustic guitar. 
Position 4:
0.8 ms attack, 5-second release. Ideal for transparent bus compression, mastering, and slower sounds. 
Program-Dependent Time Constant Settings (Positions 5-6)
These settings feature "auto-release" characteristics, where the release time changes based on the incoming audio. 
Position 5:
0.2 ms attack, 2-second release for transients and a 10-second release for multiple peaks. 
Position 6:
0.2 ms attack, 300 ms release for transients, 10 seconds for multiple peaks, and 25 seconds for sustained high-level signals. 

threshold knob - 10 step for reduction/compression A continuously variable control for adjusting the compression threshold

input gain knob - 20 to 0 A stepped attenuator provides precise control over the input level for each channel. 
The compression ratio increases as the input signal gets louder. For example, the unit can be set for a gentle 
2:1 ratio for softer compression, but will push up toward a 30:1 ratio as a brickwall limiter.
Due to its variable-mu nature, the compressor also features a soft-knee compression curve. This means the compression
 is very gentle at first and smoothly increases as the input signal grows.

TUBES

tubes illuminate brighter as input gain is driven and tubes slightly flicker to reduction)


sc hpf switch = off, 60 hz, 120 hz

comp off button - shuts off entire comp. section. (comp-on-light.png desaturates %100 to indicate off) 

output knob - min. to max. for controlling output of comp

meters (needles) - Each channel features a VU meter (baked in to face plate) for level and compression indication. needles will animate reduction/drive

link/unlink switch - for controlling left/right/mid/side individualy or left side controls both sides equally

left,right/mid,side switch - for making unit mid/side or stereo

mix knob (dry to wet) - for parallel compression wet or fully dry signal

tape->comp., comp.->tape switch - for input direction of unit preference (tape->comp. is tape unit input before comp. comp.-.tape is comp. input first)

TAPE (EMULATOR) SATURATION section features:

tape off button - shuts off entire tape section (tape-on-light.png desaturates %100 to indicate off)

trim knob -12, 0, +12 - Provides +/– 12dB adjustment of level on incoming signal levels, prior to the tape circuit.

saturation knob min., max. - Continuously variable control of the level being sent to the ‘tape effect’ circuit. 
Increasing Saturation levels drives the ‘record’ gain while simultaneously reducing the ‘replay’ gain so
 the overall output signal level remains consistent. The output signal level will decrease slightly as the
 MAX setting is approached due to the extreme saturation and soft clipping

blend 0, 100%- Continuously variable control of the mix of pre and post tape effect signals.
 This allows for precise control over the amount of saturation, tone and soft clipping produced. 
As the signal gets more saturated, reducing the blend can be an effective way to impart the sound 
of ‘tape’ while maintaining detail and transparency. NOTE: The blend control does not affect the amount of Silk Texture applied.

ips switch 7,15,30 - Push-button switch that toggles between 3 different frequency responses commonly found at 7,15 or 30 IPS tape machine speeds.
the 7 ips typical "head bump" or low-frequency resonance usually occurs in the 35–65 Hz range
 The 15 IPS mode has a significant “head bump” in the low frequencies centered around 60Hz and a more pronounced roll off in the high frequencies. 
The 30 IPS mode is generally a flatter response altogether with a “head bump” around 120Hz.

texture knob min., max. - controls how much color is applied to signal (work in conjunction with color switch)

color switch - Illuminated push-button switch that toggles through the three available color modes: OFF, orange, and BLUE. 
blue enhances harmonic content in high mid and high frequencies. orange enhances harmonic content in low and low mid frequencies

tape in button - toggles between tape section on or off but still able to use color section

drive/level meters - for animation 9 (0-off,8-max) segment LED meters are included for indicating output level and drive amount.
 The level meter displays the output level after the tape, before the color circuit, and the drive meter displays the level sent to the “record head”
 when the tape effect is engaged. The soft clip circuit is present at drive levels above 5.

BACKPLATES (SKINS) - backplates toggle between 2 skins when nu moon logo is pressed.
